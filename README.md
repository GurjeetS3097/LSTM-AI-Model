# LSTM-AI-Model
The language model with a single LSTM layer is a neural network that can generate new text based on patterns learned from a training set. Applied to the Dracula book, this model can learn the writing style of Bram Stoker and generate new text that resembles his work. Visualization can help understand how the model is learning and generating text.
